* Current project TODOs
** TODO Make menus responsive
 [2020-11-10 Tue 22:41]
(see =.css=, I guess) -- so the top menu would work on a phone.
seems like there is a manual: https://w3bits.com/css-html-menu/

Maybe a better source is: https://1stwebdesigner.com/how-to-create-a-responsive-dropdown-navigation-using-only-css/

Maybe a solution is: https://w3schoolweb.com/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/
** TODO Make the theme a separate repo
** TODO Think: maybe pack into a tangled =.org= file?
- at least the =CSS= file...
