*Summary* <hr> This is a note for someone far from software development, but
interested in tracking changes in source code and other text-based files. The
logic is built around a specific, trivial example.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup][backup]]: is protecting against data loss. So, /when/ your computer dies, you
  are not too far behind. Any sort of _regular_ backup procedure helps.
- *(our focus)* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version%5Fcontrol][version control]]: is keeping track of changes in your files. So that you know
  what did you do, when, why, and can get back if needed. There are several
  tools, [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] is /very/ popular.
- Think of it as a "protocol", and a (local) app that runs it. [[https://github.com][GitHub]] is 
  the most popular website offering hosting of git repositories.
  (There are alternatives.)
- Git is "distributed": you work in a local copy. So, it is fast, and can work
  offline[fn:offline].
- It is especially good to track any sort of plain-text files (source code,
  latex documents, markdown, etc.).
- It allows (and encourages) /branching/, when you keep several "lineages" of your
  code to test your ideas, while keeping a "clean" version easily available.
- This note contains a brief overview and discusses a simple example of
  /individual/ (not collaborative) use.
- There are *many* resources online. E.g. [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup]["ProGit"]] is a good book.
- Working from a command line helps a lot to understand what's going on, but:
- There are many excellent tools that help productivity --
  + stand-alone clients ([[https://desktop.github.com/][Github Desktop]], [[https://www.gitkraken.com/][GitKraken]], etc.);
  + some very good editor integrations -- in [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]], [[https://atom.io/][Atom]], [[https://www.sublimetext.com][Sublime]], Emacs (see
    [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]]), or almost any other serious editor or IDE.
  

  Corrections, suggestions, and comments are very [[mailto:tech_seminar@bochkarev.io][welcome]].

* Introduction
** Some context
There are two adjacent problems: backups and version control.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup][Backup]] basically means making "snapshots" for further recovery. I think the
  key is to have regular *procedure*, which any suitable tools: built-in software
  (e.g., "time machine" for Apple), [[https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][borgbackup]], or just =rsync=, etc.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control][version control systems]] are used to keep track of changes in your files.
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git][Git]] is one of the most popular ones. Alternatives include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion][subversion (SVN)]],
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial][mercurial]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version-control_software][more]]. Further we will focus on version control and,
    specifically, git.

(/Collaboration/ on code and other plain-text files is another topic, which
    happens to be addressed particularly well by git -- but this is out of the
    scope of this note.)
    
** Tools for today
    *1)* You would need to have *git* installed. Check from the command line:
    #+NAME: gitver
    #+HTML_ATTR: notalink
    #+begin_src bash :exports both
git --version
    #+end_src

    which gave me:
    #+RESULTS: gitver
    : git version 2.27.0

#+HTML: <details> <summary> [ What if not? ]</summary>
    If it did not work, start [[https://git-scm.com/download][here]]. It works out of the box on my GNU/Linux
    machine, but if I were to use other systems, I would look into [[https://gitforwindows.org/][GitForWindows]]
    (see also a larger [[https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/20au/resources/assets/vscode-git-tutorial/windows/index.html][tutorial]]), or hoped that MacOS will suggest me to install
    it automatically (or, e.g., try to =brew install git=, if not -- see [[https://brew.sh/][brew]]
    for more details).
#+HTML: </details>

As pointed out in the [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup][docs]], you would need to set your name and email (to be
associated with your changes in the code).

   #+begin_src bash
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email YourName@example.com
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main # set the name of the default branch
   #+end_src

    *2)* We will need a text editor, of course. Any one will work. I am using
    [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][(Space)Emacs]] with [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] on a daily basis, but it was more convenient to make
    a demo on [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]] ([[https://vscodium.com/][-ium]]) with a standard extension called /GitGraph/. Good
    editors have plugins that support git well and simplify many operations. For
    discussion here, I will show commands as issued from the command line, but I find
    editor integration more convenient to use for most tasks.
    
    *3)* It is convenient to see what is happening in our repo on [[https://pages.github.com/][GitHub]], so I
       used an account there for the example below. I tend to use Github pretty
       extensively to keep a copy of my code online[fn:private].
 
** On Git vs. Github
	Git is a version control system -- think a /"protocol"/. You work with a local
	app (=git=) that tracks changes in your local folder. Many providers offer
	/hosting/ compatible with git. Examples include [[https://github.com/][GitHub]], [[https://about.gitlab.com/][GitLab]], [[https://bitbucket.org][BitBucket]] and
	others. Self-hosted options are available (e.g., see [[https://gitea.io/en-us/][gitea]] or GitLab).

  Usually, third-party providers implement "social" tools as well:
	to facilitate collaborations, comments, issue tracking, etc. And also just allow
	to demonstrate what kind of code you write. I think GitHub is /de facto/
	standard at the moment.

** The big picture
A project lives in a repository (/"repo"/). In fact, it is just a folder with a
  special =.git= subfolder, where the magic happens. There is something called
  "working area", "staging area", and repositories:

#+NAME: dia_workflow

* Key concepts with a running example
** Basics: tracking changes
   Assume we would like to develop some code in Python (this will be our running
   example). So, we create a folder and immediately initialize a repo:
   #+begin_src bash :exports both
git init
   #+end_src
   Output:
   #+RESULTS:
   : Initialized empty Git repository in /home/bochkarev/sandbox/demo-repo/.git/

   It has created a special directory, =.git=, that will contain
   the information concerning the history. Now, let us add some code and
   save it as =new_doc.py=:
   #+begin_src python
print("Hello world")

for i in range(5):
	print("i=" + str(i))
   #+end_src

   Assume we have implemented some basic functionality, and would like to save a
   snapshot of this state in the repo. Note that git "knows" that we have some
   changes now:
   #+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git status
   #+end_src
   Output:
   #+RESULTS:
   : On branch master
   : 
   : No commits yet
   : 
   : Untracked files:
   :   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
   : 	new_doc.py
   : 
   : nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

   So, as git suggests, we first add the changes to the "staging area":
   #+begin_src bash
git add .
   #+end_src
Here the period =.= means "all files in the current directory" (we could have
used a specific filename instead). Now =git status= shows that we have "changes
to be committed" (saved to the versions history):

#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports output
git status
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: On branch master
: 
: No commits yet
: 
: Changes to be committed:
:   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
: 	new file:   new_doc.py
: 
We actually create a record in the versions history with:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git commit -m"first commit"
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: [master (root-commit) de41445] first commit
:  1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
:  create mode 100644 new_doc.py

Let's say, we continue the development, and add more code, so that =new_doc.py= now reads:

#+begin_src python
print("Hello world")

for i in range(5):
	for j in range(5):
		print("i=" + str(i)+", j=" + str(j))
#+end_src

 Note that git is aware of specific changes. We can highlight them by saying:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git diff
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
diff --git a/new_doc.py b/new_doc.py
index fe46b97..105a3b3 100644
--- a/new_doc.py
+++ b/new_doc.py

 print("Hello world")
 
 for i in range(5):
-	print("i=" + str(i))
+    for j in range(5):
+        print("i=" + str(i)+", j=" + str(j))
#+end_example

Indeed, we replaced the =print= line with a =print= in an inner loop: removed
lines are indicated with a minus sign in the beginning, added lines marked with
plus. Of course, it is not necessary to stare at cryptic symbols in the shell:
e.g., VSCode will highlight these changes nicely, if you switch to "Version
Control" tab and choose the changed file (=new_doc.py=):


#+HTML:![Changes highlighted](/images/ts-git/2021-02-05_13-11-46_screenshot.png#full-shadow)

If we are happy with the changes, again, we add them to the "staging" area and
"commit" to the versions history with commands:

#+begin_src bash :exports both :results output replace
git add .
git commit -m"inner loop"
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: [master acd00af] inner loop
:  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

Now, to see the commits history, we can issue:
#+begin_src bash :exports both :results output replace
git log
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

commit de41445c3b150488871ef8526b519488eda5ed26
Author: Alexey Bochkarev <a@bochkarev.io>
Date:   Fri Feb 5 13:05:17 2021 +0100

    first commit
#+end_example
Or, if we have a lot of these and want a quick overview, we might want them
in a compact form:

#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: acd00af inner loop
: de41445 first commit

Now, getting back to the commit =first commit= is as simple as =git checkout
de41445=. The repo will come back to the state at that moment, so we can look
around. For example, we could save something and get back with =git checkout
master=. Usually what I might want, however, is to fetch a specific file from a
specific commit into the current moment. I could do this with =git show
de41445:new_doc.py > old_version.py=. (After this command I will have another
file, =old_version.py=, with the contents of =new_doc.py= as of the moment of
the first commit). I will not use this file, so I will just remove it for now,
with =rm ./old_version.py=.

Experimenting and working with code is more often done with something
called /branching/.

** Branching
   So, one possible workflow is to have a "clean", main branch (say, "ready to
   show to your supervisor"), and experiment in separate versions, merging back
   those that worked out. 

   Assume we want to try to switch to nice unicode variable names (greek
   letters). First, we create a new /branch/ for this feature:

   #+begin_src bash :results output replace :export both
git checkout -b unicode_vars
   #+end_src

Now, =git status= gives:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :export results
git status
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: On branch unicode_vars
: nothing to commit, working tree clean

And the bottom left corner of my VSCodium editor also hints of the current
branch, like this:

#+HTML:![Branch name indicator](/images/ts-git/2021-02-05_16-38-40_screenshot.png#full-shadow)

Our previous state of the tracked files (one file in this case) was left in a
=master= branch, and we jumped into a separate code "spin-off". Let me 
rename a variable, so =new_doc.py= now would look like:

#+begin_src python
print("Hello world")

for É‘ in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        print("É‘=" + str(É‘)+", j=" + str(j))

#+end_src

After we save the file, VSCode (or =git diff=) will highlight for us, what has
changed:

#+HTML:![Changes highlighted](/images/ts-git/2021-02-05_16-49-00_screenshot.png#full-shadow)

Again, we commit this change:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git add .
git commit -m"renamed variables"
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: [unicode_vars 985d560] renamed variables
:  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

Assume we want to make some unrelated change now. (Suddenly! Or maybe because
we've got an email about this) E.g., remember that there is a more compact
syntax for printing strings in Python. So we go back to the main branch to edit
the file:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git checkout master
#+end_src

We are immediately back to the state we left when we made a spin-off, so we
change the file to become:
#+begin_src python
print("Hello world")

for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

#+end_src
That's way more readable, so we "save" it into the master branch:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git diff # let's see the changes
git add .
git commit -m"improved code readability (printing strings)"
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
diff --git a/new_doc.py b/new_doc.py

#+end_example

Okay, now we go back to work on our feature with =git checkout unicode_vars=.
Assume we test the feature with =python ./new_doc.py=, make sure it works, so we
want to integrate it back into the "main" branch of our code. To do this, we go
back to the =master= branch and try to merge it with the feature branch
(=unicode_vars=):
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git checkout master
git merge unicode_vars
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Auto-merging new_doc.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in new_doc.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
#+end_example

We have created a /conflict/: edited the same line in both branches, and there
is no way to resolve it automatically. This is a normal situation, and the
source file now looks as follows:
#+begin_src python :hl_lines 3
print("Hello world")

for É‘ in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
<<<<<<< HEAD
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

=======
        print("É‘=" + str(É‘)+", j=" + str(j))
>>>>>>> unicode_vars

#+end_src

This is pretty self-explanatory, but notice what has just happened. A change in
the highlighted line was straightforward to make, so git did it for us
automatically. Since =print= instruction was edited in both branches, we'd
need to edit it manually (with any editor) to our taste. Note that VSCodium
allows convenience of "Accept Change"-like buttons (which we wouldn't use in
this case, though):

#+HTML:![Changes highlighted](/images/ts-git/2021-02-05_17-10-50_screenshot.png#full-shadow)

After the edits, the resulting file is:
#+begin_src python
print("Hello world")

for É‘ in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        print("É‘={É‘}, j={j}")

#+end_src

Following the instructions, we add and commit the changes initiated by =merge=
as usual:
#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git add .
git commit -m"merged 'unicode variables' feature"
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: [master 1c7dd06] merged 'unicode variables' feature

So, again, what we have just done: we created a spin-off branch, tried to
implement a feature, introduced some changes into the "main" code along the way,
and merged everything back successfully. Many tools, including VSCode, can show
nice figures to illustrate what is going on:

#+HTML:![Changes highlighted](/images/ts-git/2021-02-05_17-21-45_screenshot.png#full-shadow)

Each point here is a commit (a "snapshot" of the state for tracked files). We
created a separate branch, then our branches diverged due to the two conflicting
commits, and then we merged everything back at the very top commit, =1c7dd06a=.

An alternative solution would be to try to /"replay"/ the changes from
=unicode_vars= branch on top of the changes in =master=, as if it were based
on /already updated =master=/ -- see git [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing][rebase]] for details.

You can check what branches are there with:

#+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git branch
#+end_src
Output:
#+RESULTS:
: * master
:   unicode_vars

To show just branches not merged into the main branch: =git branch
--no-merged master=. Branches that are no longer needed can be deleted with
=git branch -d <branch-name>=.

There are some materials on branching strategies and git workflows (e.g., on
[[https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/]["git-flow"]] and [[https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/][GitHub flow]], with the latter being focused on simple
collaboration) -- but this discussion looked somewhat too complicated for my
own needs at the moment.

** Dealing with a remote repo
   Even if you work alone on your code, you might still want to use a concept of
   remote repos. For example, if you are running separate experiments on the
   cluster and would like to (1) keep them under version control, and (2) run
   them in parallel. But let us consider another (perhaps, more general) common
   use case, when you would like to sync your local repo with a remote version
   on Github -- e.g., to keep things backed up online, or to share code.

   Creating a remote GitHub repo is simple. Assume we have a /local/ repository
   first (the one we discussed above would work). We go ahead and [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo][create a
   Github repo]] (not initializing it with anything). Essentially, Github will
   give you both the address and commands to use to connect your local repo with
   its remote counterpart. Afterwards, a /remote/ will act mostly as another
   /branch(es)/. You could =pull= changes to your local repo from the remote,
   =push= your local changes back to the remote, and so on. For example:
- =git remote add origin <Github-address>= will make git aware of the specific
  remote repo, and will call this remote repo =origin=.
- alternatively, for an existing /remote/ repo, which you would like to have in
  your local folder, you issue =git clone <repo-address>=.
- =git push -u origin master= will push your local changes from =master= branch
  to =origin= (on a Github server).
- =git pull= will try to pull changes from the remote (assigned by the previous
  =push -u= command) and =merge= it into the current branch.[fn:editGH]

  
  A repository on the Github can be marked as "public", so that anyone would be
  able to see the code (see [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility][a note on visibility]]). For example,
  source code for this website is available at
  https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/bochkarev.io. You can create =README= file,
  so it will be shown by default when someone opens your repository (and it is a
  good practice to create one, describing what is this repo about, how to
  contribute, etc. -- at least very briefly. See [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes][About READMEs]]). Perhaps, the
  most widespread format is =.md= in [[https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/][(Github's) Markdown]], but there is [[https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/README.md#markups][more]].
  
* Some tips, tricks, and notes
** Adding changes
   Interestingly, you can not only add /changed files/ to a commit, but pick
   specific changes /within/ a file -- if you happened to make two logically
   different edits and would like to keep them in different commits. For
   example, in VSCode you can pick ("stage") specific changes in the main editor
   window by pressing this "plus" sign:

#+HTML:![Changes highlighted](/images/ts-git/indiv_changes.png#full-shadow)
  
  If you happened to =git add= something wrong, you can always =git reset=. It
 will not *not* alter any files, but remove everything from the
 "stage area", so you can start staging again.

** Tags
  Sometimes I want to mark certain commit with a meaningful comment -- to be
  able to get back to this version quickly, if needed. See git [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging][tags]]: =git tag
  -m"Submitted to the journal" v1.0= followed by =git push --tags= will create a
  tag =v1.0= with a comment =Submitted to the journal= and push it to a remote.
  Now, you can, e.g.:
  - quickly get back to this version with =git checkout v1.0=.
  - click "Tags" button on Github, choose =v1.0= and download a =.zip= file with
    this version.
** Exploring the past
   Sometimes it is handy to browse through past versions of the code. Apart from
   the =git log= and =git checkout= mentioned above, the Github interface might
   help. Note that you can click on any commit there and browse the repo (in a
   web browser) as it was back then.

   An overview for changes in a specific file with contributors can be called
   with "History" or "Blame" buttons (see also [[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame][git-blame]] docs). Note that Github
   web interface shows =master= / =main= branch by default, but you can choose
   any branch/tag/commit to explore. It helps sometimes to answer questions like
   "where have this figure come from? Which version of my code?..".
   
Sometimes it is also handy to have the current commit and branch (automatically
-- e.g., to include into a log file). The following commands might help:

    #+begin_src bash :results output replace :exports both
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD # current branch
git rev-parse HEAD # current commit
    #+end_src
Output:
    #+RESULTS:
    : master
    : 1c7dd06adb46c63e2706babd2500c040e934d80e

** Ignoring files
   Sometimes you want to issue a simple =git add .= command, but do not want
   some files to be tracked at all. Maybe some backup files, the ones related to
   personal configurations that have nothing to do with the "public" repo, large
   problem instances, intermediary results, auxiliary things (=__pycache__= for
   python projects, etc.). To do this, just add a special =.gitignore= file with
   file names (can include wildcards). See also [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring][ProGit]], [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files][GitHub docs]], and
   some [[https://github.com/github/gitignore][examples]].
   
** Large files
   As a special case, there is a problem of large files. GitHub imposes a [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota][strict
   limit]] on file sizes of 100 Mb per file (as of writing this). I do not know a
   good solution to this problem, but:
   1. *The key point:* It is questionable if 100 Mb+ files and/or binary files
      really /need/ text-based version control. See =.gitignore= above.
   2. There is something called [[https://git-lfs.github.com/][git LFS]] (Large file storage.) I tried to use it
      once: seemed convenient, but I had a feeling that I am out of control
      regarding my current quotas, etc. So I decided for myself to avoid it
      whenever possible.
   3. See also [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/working-with-large-files][GitHub docs]] on large files.
   4. It seems like there is an attempt to solve this problem specifically for
      ML projects called [[https://dvc.org/][Data Version Control (DVC)]]. See also Dolt and their
      [[https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-06-so-you-want-git-for-data/][blogpost on "GitHub for data"]]. These caught my eye, but I have no
      first-hand experience.
   5. Please, [[/contact/][let]] me know if you are aware of any good solution, especially
      relevant to OR / DataScience.
      
** Jupyter notebooks
  I do not use =.ipynb= actively at the moment, so I can't give any good
recommendations. First, I do not know any good solution to version-control
[[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] notebooks. Git is still useful, since =.ipynb= are basically text files,
just does not allow to see differences conveniently. ([[https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyter-version-control/][A note]] on this.)

 Note that Github is not always best even with /showing/ (rendering) the
notebooks. It might help to use a separate solution to link your notebooks
hosted on Gihtub -- e.g., see https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. Google Colab also
[[https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb][offers]] loading public notebooks from Github (as I write this). If you
specifically need /executing/ notebooks online, you might be better off looking
into [[https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb][Google Colab]] or [[https://mybinder.org/][binder]].
  
** Submodules
   If you ever find yourself in need of a "repo-in-a-repo" (e.g., when you use a
   library that you'd like to version-control separately) -- see [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules][submodules]].
   
** Github Pages
   Github offers a simple website hosting integrated with git -- for projects
   and/or personal webpages. See [[https://pages.github.com/][GithubPages]] for up to date details.
   
** Collaboration and Github
    This is basically outside of this note's scope, but of course, possible
    collaborations and social interactions are strong points of Github.
    - You can [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo]["fork"]] a repository easily (to work locally and, perhaps, propose
      contributions back); a simple [[https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/][Hello World]] tutorial might help.
    - There is an [[https://guides.github.com/features/issues/][issue-tracking]] mechanism and per-project [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis][Wiki]].
    - and so on. Again, there is a large, separate topic.

* Footnotes

[fn:editGH] Note that you can edit files directly on Github, via a web
interface. It will just create commits on the respective branch of the /remote/ repo.

[fn:private] Note that you can make a repo "private", so no one by default will
have access, besides you. (see the [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility][docs]])

[fn:offline] Note that you do not need a Github account to work with git. I have
several repos completely offline -- just to track versions locally. You do not
loose anything this way, except collaboration features and an off-site backup.
