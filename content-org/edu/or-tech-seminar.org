|--------+-------------------------------|
| Online | Weekly: Mondays, 10-00 AM EST |

* The format
  We will be discussing various tools (in a very broad sense) we, as
  researchers, use -- to share experience, configs, and ideas. Each seminar will
  consist of a speaker presentation with a discussion along the way, at most
  one hour in total. <br/> <br/>

** Upcoming seminar: [2021-02-01 Mon 10:00]
   ðŸ’» *All things version-control:* a quick intro to Git.
   <hr/>
   
   *Suggestion:* come with git [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][installed]], and a [[https://github.com][Github]] account.<br> 
   (check that =git --version= gives you something in the terminal)
   + Version control, backups, when to use (always!)
   + Git, github, and the team.
   + Repositories (remote, local). Create, fork, =clone=, and other spells.
   + Keeping track of your code/text: =add=, =commit=, =push/pull=.
   + Workflow / branches -- =checkout, merge=, rebasing, conflicts.

* Core discussion
1. ðŸ“° *Working with the literature:* tools and approaches. (2021-01-25) @@html:
   <a class="sticker" href="/tools/ts-literature/">&nbsp;Summary&nbsp;</a>@@
   + Managing references (Zotero, JabRef, Mendeley and friends).
   + Using the literature: latex/bibtex, editors, etc. (very brief)
   + Discovering the literature (feeds, mailing lists, etc.)
   + A note on notes.
2. *ðŸ’» All things version-control:* a quick intro to Git. /(next seminar -- see
   above)/
3. ðŸŒ§ *(Cloud) The Command Line - 1:* Surviving on the cloud.
   + Logging in to the cluster. Login shell vs. comp node. Bash-related basics
     (moving around, editing, installing things, etc.).
   + Running things: commands, aliases, pipes, =stdout/stderr=, scripts,
     access rights (=chmod=). Very intro bash scripting.
   + Some utils (=tar=, =head=, =tail=, =split=, =shuf=, etc.)
4. ðŸŒ© *(Cloud) The Command Line - 2:* making it work for you.
   + Moving things between remote and local machines (=scp=, =rsync=, =github=, etc.).
   + Running jobs on the cluster: PBS basics; modules, file systems.
   + Running things in parallel (a quick [[https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/][GNU parallel]] demo, etc.).
   + Possibly, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile][Makefiles]].

* Additional topics (work in progress)
1. ðŸ’» *Introductory materials on Python*:
   + Syntax basics / learning resources.
   + Versions, environments, managing packages (=conda=, =pip=)
   + Jupyter notebooks (extracting code, presenting, exporting, JupyterHub,
     etc. A word on alternatives)
   + Optimization in Python (with [[https://www.gurobi.com/][Gurobi]] solver and =gurobipy=) -- a quick example.
   + A word on scripting in Python (maybe a quick example).
   + Further reading.
2. ðŸ’» *Selected materials on Julia*. Note: we have a collection of materials on
   different topics related to [[https://julialang.org/][Julia]] from the previous year seminars by [[https://msiddig.people.clemson.edu/][Murwan
   Siddig]] -- see his @@html: <a href="https://github.com/murwansiddig/Julia_tutorials">Julia tutorials</a>@@ repo.
3. ðŸ‘“ *Selected topics on programming.*
   + Speeding up code in Python: special libraries, loops, vectorized computations, =map=,
     etc.
   + "Profiling" python code ("what's so slow?")
   + ... and in Julia: very brief notes on parallel computations and precompiling.
