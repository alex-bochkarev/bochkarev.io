* Introduction
  I would like to discuss the /problem/, i.e. requirements to an IT system
  supporting my basic workflow, and then the /solution/ that worked for me. It
  may or may not work for /you/ of course, but hopefully will provide some
  inputs to design your own IT "ecosystem". Here is a very general (and
  therefore, useless by itself) description of the relevant workflow:

This is a large topic, but roughly speaking the system[fn:PIM] has two
key components that manage:
- references (like, bibliography data, such as =.bib= entries, plain text
  authors-titles-year-etc, perhaps, along with PDF files);
- notes (that reflect your thinking process related to this paper/piece of information).

It can be organized in *many* ways (including some good old paper-based versions
that were [[https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2942475/2942530/jschmidt_2016_niklas%20luhmanns%20card%20index.pdf][reported]] to be... very productive, to say the least[fn:hum]; a little
more on this below). I had the following specific *requirements* in mind:
- The system must be *future-proof*. Research is (hopefully) a long-term
  endeavor, so lock-in with proprietary technologies is not acceptable. I must
  be able to move to an alternative solution, if I'd like to. Key data must be
  stored in some formats that allow for recovery with very basic tools (at least
  in theory): plain text is best, open standards and free software are my
  friends. Oh yes, and I don't want to store my data in cloud all the time, I
  love tools that work offline.
- It must let me to do the following things:
  + *capture* a paper from a browser easily (or any other /source/ -- maybe a
    web page, a book, etc.), retrieving bibliographical info automatically when
    possible (including metadata extraction from PDFs).
  + *manage* references efficiently (edit fields, etc.), categorize things, etc.
  + play well with *LaTeX* (mostly, looking for and inserting citations).
- (something that I hope you will ignore:) a large benefit for me had anything
  that worked well within [[https://xkcd.com/378/][Emacs]].

  
  The core component of such system is, of course, a /bibliography-/,
  /citation-/, or /reference-manager/.
  
* On references and bibliography
  A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_management_software][reference-management]] software is a tool that lets you to (surprise!) manage
  references, i.e., bibliographical data: author, title, publisher data, etc.
  That is, it captures and stores the bibliographical /data/ in some internal
  format (e.g., a =.bib= file, an [[https://sqlite.org][SQLite]] database, etc.), and then can format it
  as you'd like: using the chosen [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation#Styles][citation style]] and producing outputs in plain
  text, word processor document, etc. It also usually helps to generate
  bibliographies automatically, so that it updates when you update the text.

  There are several key programs/services out there, and an infinite variety of
  their comparative analyses:
  - Wikipedia has pretty large [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software][comparison summary tables]]. It might be a good
    place to start, but the number of options is overwhelming.
  - Another detailed comparison was made in [[https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1320978/1320978.pdf][Technische Universität München]]. 
  - University libraries usually have brief overviews of the software they
    recommend: e.g., a nice one from [[https://ucsd.libguides.com/howtocite/compare][UCSD]], [[https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/publichealth/citations][UC Berkeley]], [[https://guides.library.upenn.edu/citationmgmt][U. of Pennsylvania]].
    Also: [[https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write][MiT]] (specifically on [[https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write/citetools][citation management]]), [[https://guides.library.harvard.edu/cite][Harvard]], [[https://library.stanford.edu/research/bibliography-management][Stanford]], [[https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/citations/citation-tools][U. of
    Washington]],
  - There are numerous Reddit discussions (such as: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/iouswl/jabref_vs_zotero_vs_orgref_which_one_do_you/][JabRef vs Zotero vs org-ref]])
  - Of course, there is a paper[fn:recursive] on that: cite:ivey2018. 
    

  /Before we start: it might be important what your colleagues are using. Using
  the "lab-default" tools might make the choice very simple and efficient./

  My personal short list would overlap with the Clemson Library's [[https://libraries.clemson.edu/research/citation-management/][one]]
  (at the time of writing this): [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]], [[https://www.jabref.org/][JabRef]]; plus [[https://mendeley.com/][Mendeley]], [[https://refworks.proquest.com/researcher/][Refworks]]
  (Clemson [[https://clemson.libguides.com/newrefworks][guide]]), [[https://endnote.com/][EndNote]] if I allow for commercial products (I have also read
  some good things about [[https://www.papersapp.com/][Papers]] for Mac -- but never had a chance to look
  myself). This list is not exhaustive (by far), so please refer to more
  complete resources (including the ones mentioned above) if you'd need. Despite
  the problem seems somewhat standard from the first sight, it seems that
  different people demand different things, so there is no "universal" solution.
  Instead of trying to discuss pros and cons, let me just try to sketch what
  works for me.

* My Zotero-based system.
Here is my system in a nutshell, from a technology perspective:  
#+NAME: dia_system
#+begin_src plantuml :file ./ts-literature/system.svg
@startuml
folder Docs as "Incoming docs" {
  cloud web as "Web pages"
  file PDF as "PDF files"
}

folder Zotero as "Zotero system" {
        database DB as "SQLite database"
        folder PDFs as "PDF storage (folder)"
        node ffplug as "Firefox plugin"
        node LOplug as "LibreOffice/MS Word plugin"
}

file bib as "Bibtex file (.bib)"

folder docs as "Manuscript" {
        file latex_doc as "Latex document"
        file g_doc as "Google doc"
        file LO_doc as "LibreOffice / MS Word doc"
}

folder dropbox as "Dropbox folder (tablet)" {
        file PDF_copy as "PDF (copy)"
}

DB <--> PDFs
PDF --> PDFs
PDFs <--> PDF_copy
PDF --> ffplug
web <--> ffplug
ffplug <--> DB

DB --> bib
bib --> latex_doc
ffplug --> g_doc
DB --> LOplug
LOplug --> LO_doc

note top of bib: Auto-export on every change.
note bottom of dropbox: Send/retrieve files (with annotations) upon request.
note bottom of latex_doc: Edit using my favorite editor (supporting many cool things)
@enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: dia_system
[[file:./system.svg]]

So, basically, I use the following tools:
- Zotero desktop app
- Firefox plugin ([[https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors]["Connector"]]) to fetch info from the web
- Zotero addons (there is a larger [[https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins][list]] of these):
  + BetterBibTex to make the =.bib= related magic happen;
  + LibreOffice integration (think MS Word);
  + ZotFile to be able to manipulate PDFs easily, including sending them to the tablet.

Now, the "manuscript" part can be implemented, again in several ways, and the
purpose here is to supercharge your editor to get info from the =.bib= file. My
[[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Emacs (Spacemacs)]] handles this for me:[fn:layers]

I have a convenient (fuzzy) search / auto-completion when I insert the keys:

  [[./ts-literature/org_insert_citation.gif]]

And also I can easily pull out a PDF or my notes when I need to:

[[./ts-literature/org_open_pdf_notes.gif]]

For these rare cases when I use MS Word-like environments, there are
LibreOffice and Google Docs integration:

[[./ts-literature/gdoc_insert_citation.gif]]

(It is also worth noting that you can just find a paper in Zotero and copy a
citation in the necessary citation style, e.g., as a plain text -- to insert it
anywhere.)

If you find it interesting -- there are many demos and tutorials on Zotero on
YouTube and other places (most probably, including a dedicated training in your
university library).

* A word on LaTeX ecosystem.
  I was somehow confused with the LaTeX-related systems, and found a relevant
  [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib][TeX.StackExchange]] question. In a nutshell:

#+NAME: latex_system
#+begin_src plantuml :file ./ts-literature/latex.svg
@startuml
database bib as "Bibliography (.bib)" 
file tex as "Manuscript (.tex document)"
folder soft as "External programs ('backend')" {
        node bibtex
        node biber
}

folder packages as "LaTeX packages" {
        node natbib
        node biblatex
}

file style as "Style description"
note top of style: Package-specific (e.g., <b>.bst</b> for natbib)

bib --> soft
bibtex --> natbib
bibtex --> biblatex
biber --> biblatex
style --> packages
packages --> tex

note right of bib : Keeps bibliography data
note bottom of soft: An interface - processes the .bib
note left of packages: format citations and bibliographies.
@enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: latex_system
  
  
As far as I understand, one of the ideas behind =biblatex= was to move away from
a separate style definition language, =BST= (see also a [[http://tug.ctan.org/info/bibtex/tamethebeast/ttb_en.pdf][manual]] on BibTeX). While
the SE question mentioned above helped my understanding, but I believe this
topic is better suited for another day. Eventually, everything is determined by
the journal -- style description format they provide.

* A note on notes.
  This is, actually, a separate topic. But if you feel the necessity to take
  notes on your research in general (like an extended lab journal), there are
  many options.

  Basically, we are talking about a collection of interlinked notes. There are
  several relevant "keywords" out there that I would like to mention.
  - First, one might take a technological perspective and look for software that
    allows to manage notes. This is, of course, good old Evernote[fn:evernote],
    a newer and open source[fn:MIT] [[https://joplinapp.org/][Joplin]]. (There are people among my friends
    who keep their research notes there.)
  - There is and a vast variety of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software][wiki software]] (such as [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki][DokuWiki]] or [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki][MediaWiki]],
    just to name a couple. But the list is huge.) Some of them are specifically
    positioned as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki][Personal Wiki]] (e.g., such as [[https://tiddlywiki.com/][TiddlyWiki]] -- see a nice 2.5
    minutes [[https://tiddlywiki.com/#Introduction%20Video][intro video]]).
  - There are specific solutions for working with an interconnected grid of
    "evergreen" notes (i.e., the ones you might edit every time when you visit
    them.) I would like to mention:
    + [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam]]. It looks totally exciting, but web-based (which
      is a big no-go for me);
    + [[https://obsidian.md/][Obsidian]]. Comparable thing, uses local storage, as far as I can tell.
      Ironically, I am not sure how good is it with citations/references 😀.
      Never used it at all, but to me, it looks *very* promising (especially if
      it indeed keeps your information in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][markdown]], which is essentially plain
      text, so you can open it in future no matter what).
    + [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]]. This is a part of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] ecosystem over the all-mighty[fn:org]
      [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode]]. Free and open source, local solution. This is what I use
      currently.
  - Then, there is a story about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]]. A slip-box with notes.
    Essentially, this is a /method/ for keeping a grid of interlinked, small
    notes (and letting them evolve over time). The idea is that after some time
    you actually build such an "external brain" that conversations with it
    becomes surprisingly productive, letting you to create new connections and
    ideas. Again, this is a /method/, not a software tool. In fact, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann#Note-taking_system_(Zettelkasten)][one]] of the
    most famous /Zettelkästen/ was implemented as a wooden box with drawers,
    filled with small (paper) notes. It is worth noting: its author, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann#Note-taking_system_(Zettelkasten)][Niklas
    Luhmann]], was doing Sociology, and this approach might (or might not) be less
    effective for math-heavy fields. Anyways: It seems to be a vast topic, and
    there is a lot of resources out there, if you are interested further, including:
    + 🗎 *Paper:* the original Luhmann's paper cite:luhmann1981 /"Kommunikation mit
      Zettelkästen"/ (in German 🇩🇪);
    + 💬 *Community:* [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/b566a4/what_is_a_zettelkasten/][r/Zettelkasten]] on Reddit (the linked note includes couple of
      good links on the subject; and there is a community [[https://zk.zettel.page/][wiki]], hosted
      separately)
    + 📖 *Book:* [[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18635700W/How_to_Take_Smart_Notes]["How to Take Smart Notes..."]] by Sönke Ahrens.
      Despite it has the sort of title I dislike very much, I found the book
      pretty useful and informative[fn:newport]. (It might be still a little
      longer than necessary, to my taste.)
  - On the contrary, someone from my friends just work on a relatively small
    number of notes in =.tex= format (something like "internal papers" in his
    lab).

    
  *Finally:* it seems to me that specific /tools/ are not as important as
    discipline, habits and procedures we set up for ourselves. Of course, a
    labjournal in one form or another is a must. I liked a point that came up in
    one of private conversations recently, that /notes/ is your product when you
    are not working on a specific paper. And when you accumulate enough of them
    -- all this can "graduate" to a paper. (Which is surprisingly along the
    lines Dr. Luhmann as saying, as far as I understand.)

* Discovering the literature
  
  I wanted to jot down a couple of words on (and discuss) /discovering/ the
  literature. Like, where do papers new can come from.

  Before we start: your library might provide a surprising amount of useful
  resources! E.g., Clemson University Libraries offer [[https://libraries.clemson.edu/find/research-course-guides/]["Research & Course Guides"]]
  (with specific sections on [[https://clemson.libguides.com/IE][Industrial Engineering]], [[https://clemson.libguides.com/Mathematics][Mathematics]], and [[https://clemson.libguides.com/ComputerScience][Computer
  Science]]). I would like to thank our Librarian Jennifer Groff for a very
  productive email conversation, which helped me a lot in preparing this
  discussion and research in general. There might be more useful sources --
  check out the website!

** 🔎 Proactive search
   Who doesn't know about free search? Right, right... But still:
   - Just Google search is (un)surprisingly good, sometimes.
   - [[https://scholar.google.com][Google.Scholar]] is handy when you are specifically looking for research
     papers. (It also provides citation data along the way.) What is more
     important: having a paper =X=, it allows to make more complicated requests,
     e.g., find all the papers that cite =X=, find new papers by keywords among
     those citing =X=, and such things.
   - There are specialized (commercial, usually subscription-based)
     resources/databases to search for papers: the most general ones are,
     perhaps, (Elsevier's) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus][Scopus]] and (Clarivate's) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science][Web of Science]]. Also, there
     is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathSciNet][MathSciNet]], [[https://www.engineeringvillage.com/][EngineeringVillage]], etc. Of course, there is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines][more]] -- these
     are just random examples. For me, this is something that would allow more
     complicated searches than Google Scholar can handle (at least at the moment
     of writing these notes). I never used these for long periods of time
     directly -- it seemed like the simple option was good enough (but I'd love
     to learn your experience, if it is different!).
   - (surprise!) The University Library. For example, Clemson Libraries has
     subscriptions to many databases, and allows to (1) search across these,
     and (2) retrieve paywalled papers. So, I found this [[https://libraries.clemson.edu/]["everything" library
     search]] pretty useful. Note that there are some other databases (check out
     the "Library databases" button) that might be useful. It seems pointless to
     provide lists (ask your librarian!), but to give a random sample from more
     than *500* (!) databases:
     + [[https://methods.sagepub.com/][SAGE Research Methods]]
     + [[https://credoreference.com][CREDO reference]] (search across encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc.)
     + [[https://about.proquest.com/libraries/academic/dissertations-theses/pqdtglobal.html][ProQuest Disserations and Theses Global]]
   - as a separate note: if you are at CU: note that Clemson Libraries provide
     trainings on what is out there and how to use it: e.g., see /"Introducing
     Library Research Strategies and Navigating the Clemson Libraries"/ from
     [[https://grad360.sites.clemson.edu/index.php][Grad360]] -- seems to be scheduled for [2021-01-29].
     
   Now, that was /proactive/ search. There are also more or less obvious methods
   to receive papers, well, automatically. Apart from the obvious Twitter (or
   whatever other social networks are used in your subfield's community) these are:
   
** 📰 Feeds: RSS, atom
   There is a web [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)][standard]] for "feeds", making websites machine readable. The
   idea is that instead of checking relevant websites frequently yourself, you
   delegate this task to the computer (we're engineers, after all, right?). A
   special program, feed /reader/, or a feed /aggregator/ checks out the websites that support such
   technology, and lets you know if a new paper / blog post / web page on the
   site was published. As simple as that. A couple of notes here:
   + Speaking about software, I would mention Mozilla [[https://www.thunderbird.net][Thunderbird]] or [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] (if
     you are into Emacs ecosystem) -- this is what I tried to use, but I don't
     really have an overview, so can't comment. Chances are, your default
     desktop email client (if you happen to use it), or a browser (Safari?) also
     can do that. Of course, there is a huge [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators][comparison table]] on Wiki. There are
     web solutions (e.g., [[https://feedly.com/][Feedly]]), which I have no clue about.
   + Now, for this to work it must be supported by the /website/. Yeah, so it
     wouldn't be able to show you ads (for example). So, not everyone is
     supporting this. There are some solutions that try to circumvent this and
     try to build an RSS feed for you (see [[https://feed43.com/][Feed43]])
   + Some journals provide RSS/Atom feeds: e.g., IJOC, EJOR, OPRE, etc.
   + Preprint servers might have feeds -- e.g., arXiv [[https://arxiv.org/help/rss][mentions]] subjects feeds,
     updated daily. (unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge [[http://www.optimization-online.org/][Optimization
     Online]] does not do this.
   
** 📨 Mailing lists
   - Web of Science, Engineering Village, Google Scholar (and, perhaps, many
     others) allow to set up citation alerts (e.g., weekly/monthly notifications
     on your search results; alerts for new publications from a specific author,
     etc.)
   - Some journals offer email subscriptions instead of feeds, sending out list
     of papers, abstracts, etc. (e.g., Mathematical Programming)
   - There might be other mailing lists worth mentioning (seminars, departmental
     lists, etc. -- please let me know if you think I missed something worth
     mentioning separately).

** 💬 Journal club and other seminars
   - Usually there seem to be efforts to read and share relevant papers in the
     community. I know at least one relatively large lab that systematically
     keeps track of many relevant journals and present "fresh" papers during a
     regular (internal) event.
   - There are also studies-focused reading clubs (aimed to learn how to write
     good papers, rather than to keep track of cutting-edge research).
   - We might want to make one, but this is a topic for another day.
     
* Concluding remarks and further reading
  - We have Clemson Libraries [[https://clemson.libcal.com/calendar/training?cid=3593&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=3593&inc=0][trainings/events]], including [[https://clemson.libcal.com/event/7336551]["Zotero for Citation Management"]].
  - Now as I think about it: JabRef-based system might be better as it would
    have fewer moving parts, but as of now it seems not worth the hassle of
    setting everything up again...
* References :ignore:
  bibliographystyle:unsrt
  bibliography:/home/bochkarev/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib

* Footnotes

[fn:newport] It left me with the same kind of feeling as the brilliant [[https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/]["Deep
work"]] by Cal Newport.

[fn:org] Speaking about orgmode: you can check out this great Bernt Hansen's
      page to see what's possible. But despite I like this technology *a lot*, I
      must admit it is still a DIY type of thing, to my taste

[fn:MIT] From what I understand, it is actually free -- MIT-licensed.

[fn:evernote] which I do not like as it is too much cloud-based and not, um...
    hacker friendly, to my feelings. For example, I do not quite understand how
    to export my stuff quickly and without losses, should I happen to need this...

[fn:layers] I use layers: =bibtex, pdf=, and =org-roam= + =org-roam-bibtex=
along with =helm= and such (a mandatory link to my [[https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/my-spacemacs-dotfiles][dotfiles]]). If
you are into Emacs world, you might find it useful to watch this EmacsConf2020
[[https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/17/][talk]] by [[https://noorahalhasan.com/][Noorah Alhasan]], which discusses a very similar approach.

[fn:recursive] Needless to say, this citation was inserted here using
Zotero in under 1 minute (and I have a downloaded PDF as a by-product).

[fn:PIM] Which is by the way a part of something that is usually called Personal
Information Management ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management][PIM]]) or Personal Knowledge Management ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management][PKM]]) systems.
These two do not seem well-defined concepts, in my opinion, but do have something to do
with very important topics, especially for a researcher.

[fn:hum] This is in Sociology -- but I believe the benefits should translate
well to STEM, at least to some extent.
