I have designed from scratch and delivered two mini-courses for [School for
Molecular and Theoretical Biology](https://molbioschool.org/en/) (SMTB) and
Puschino Winter School. Both were aimed at gifted high school students (and, perhaps,
early undergrads), and comprised four 50-minutes sessions each:
- [A Glimpse into Algorithms](/teaching/smtb-algo) (2020, 2021): a quick crash-course-intro to algorithms and
  data structures from the computational perspective.
- [Practical Introduction to Probability Theory](/teaching/smtb-prob) (2021): intro to some key
  concepts built around illustrations in Python.

Two characteristic properties of these courses were that I tried to design them
- (1) without hiding too much complexity and oversimplifying things, and
- (2) building the material from a practical perspective of numerical illustrations,
  encouraging to discuss and play with the code.

Also, I believe that learning need not necessarily happen in the
form of courses, so we have been working with the CU INFROMS Student Chapter on
two series of seminars:
- ["OR Tech Seminar"](/edu/or-tech-seminar/) (Spring 2021): discussion of the
  "researchers' toolbox"
- Journal club on network optimization and interdiction (Fall 2021): learning
  to read papers and do science.

Below is a complete list of my notes and materials related to teaching. Any feedback /
suggestions / corrections are very welcome!
