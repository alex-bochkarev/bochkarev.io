My recent teaching experience comprises two parts: I have been teaching
"mini-courses" for summer/winter schools, and participating in some activities
in my current university (mostly organizing seminars). This page provides some
details on these, along with a full list of my shorter notes that
I think might be useful for teaching in one or another way.

## Mini-courses
I have designed from scratch and delivered two mini-courses for [School for
Molecular and Theoretical Biology](https://molbioschool.org/en/) (SMTB) and
Puschino Winter School. Both were aimed at (gifted) high school students and
undergrads. They had nothing to do with the high school program, but I obviously
needed to exercise some care with respect to prerequisites. Each course
comprised four 50-minutes sessions.

### "A glimpse into Algorithms."
![Runtimes figure](./smtb_algo.png#full-shadow)

**Summary:** Introducing and illustrating some key concepts from CS using simple
numerical experiments in Python. A crash-course-intro to algorithms and data structures
from the computational perspective. E.g., discussing correctness starting from unit
tests; asymptotic, best/worst case, and other concepts related to runtime ---
with measuring actual runtime in seconds using Python's `time` module, etc. The
purpose was to mention the key ideas, demonstrate that they are (1) not "scary",
and (2) pretty relevant to the practice, even if you are not an (aspiring)
computer scientist or a programmer. (This aspect was especially relevant since
majority of the students had a background in biology, but was interested in
computational aspects as well.)

**More details:** for syllabus, a few methodological notes, and links to
actual teaching materials (slides / jupyter notebooks) see ðŸ‘‰ [here](/teaching/smtb-algo).

### "Practical Introduction to Probability Theory"
![Experiment with sample mean and variance](./smtb_probs.png#full-shadow)

**Summary:** This is a *theoretical* course, i.e., aimed in first place to
introduce and discuss the concepts of probability space, random events,
independence, random variables, and some others. However, it is presented kind of
"backwards": starting from numerical experiments and trying to
"reverse-engineer" the logic behind the math that we actually have in
Probability theory. The ultimate goal was to build (together with the students)
a usable, practical, but consistent mathematical model of random events.

actual teaching materials (slides / jupyter notebooks) see ðŸ‘‰ [here](/teaching/smtb-probs).


## Seminars at Clemson University
I believe that learning need not necessarily happen in the
form of courses, so we have been working with the CU INFROMS Student Chapter on
two series of seminars:
- **OR Tech Seminar** (Spring 2021): discussion of the "researchers' toolbox".
  I have presented a series of four one-hour seminars on working with the
  literature, organizing notes, version control, command line, etc. [(more
  details)](/edu/or-tech-seminar/)
- **Journal club** on network optimization and interdiction (Fall 2021): we have
  organized regular meetings, basically, to learn how to read papers
  and how to do (good) science.
