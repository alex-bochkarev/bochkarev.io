A researcher in Operations Research / Industrial Engineering focusing on
mathematical optimization. 

**Research interests:** mathematical programming, combinatorial optimization, networks, interdiction, decision diagrams, dynamic programming, reinforcement learning. 

I am broadly interested in combinatorial optimization and networks. My [current
projects](/research/) take different perspectives on capturing and leveraging
structure in optimization problems involving graphs. I am trying to achieve this
using binary decision diagrams and, more recently, game playing and
reinforcement learning methods.

**Education**: PhD OR/IE (2021; [dissertation](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_dissertations/2915/)) from
Clemson University, with Dr.&nbsp;[J.&nbsp;Cole Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=87CaUHYAAAAJ), MSc Appl. Maths & Physics (2010), MA Economics (2010).

**Before the academia:** management consulting and electric energy, 
focus on infrastructure projects, strategy and efficiency in transmission grids.


Please refer to my [CV](/bochkarev_cv.pdf) and the [programming stack](/notes/stack/) I use for more details.
