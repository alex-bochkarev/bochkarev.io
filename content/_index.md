I am a PhD candidate at Clemson University, focusing on research in Industrial
Engineering / Operations Research. Specifically, I work on mathematical
optimization with Dr.&nbsp;[J.&nbsp;Cole Smith](https://colesmit.expressions.syr.edu/).

**Research interests:** mathematical programming, combinatorial optimization, networks, interdiction, decision diagrams, dynamic programming, reinforcement learning.

I am broadly interested in combinatorial optimization and networks. My [current
projects](/research/) take different perspectives on capturing and leveraging
structure in optimization problems involving graphs. I am trying to achieve this
using binary decision diagrams and, more recently, game playing and
reinforcement learning methods.

**Education**: PhD OR/IE (exp. 2021), MSc Appl. Maths & Physics (2010), MA Economics (2010).

**Before the academia:** management consulting and electric energy, 
focus on infrastructure projects, strategy and efficiency in transmission grids
(several years of experience in Russia). 

Please refer to my [CV](/bochkarev_cv.pdf) and the [programming stack](/notes/stack/) I use for more details.
