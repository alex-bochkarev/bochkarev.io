This is an overview page for "OR Tech Seminar" organized with support from
[Clemson INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cecas.clemson.edu/informs/). Date and time[^fn:1] for specific events will be posted here
once agreed upon. All materials will be also linked from the seminar descriptions
below. Everything is subject to change. Comments and
suggestions are very [welcome](mailto:tech%5Fseminar@bochkarev.io).

## The format {#the-format}

We will be discussing various tools (in a very broad sense) we, as
researchers, use -- to share experience, configs, and ideas. Each seminar will
consist of a speaker presentation with a discussion along the way, at most
one hour in total. <br/> <br/>

### Upcoming seminar: <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2021-02-08 Mon 10:00]</span></span> {#upcoming-seminar}

ðŸŒ§ **(Cloud) Intro to the Command Line. (1/2)**
<hr/>
Notes on the cluster / working in the shell (topics for two seminars):

-   logging in / comp nodes vs. login shell, a note on file systems.
-   Moving things between remote and local machines (`scp`, `rsync`, `github`, etc.).
-   Shell-related basics (moving around, editing, installing things, etc.).
-   Running things: commands, aliases, pipes, `stdout/stderr`, scripts,
    access rights (`chmod`). Very intro bash scripting.
-   Some utils (`tar`, `head`, `tail`, `split`, `shuf`, etc.)
-   Running jobs on the cluster: PBS basics; modules.
-   Running things in parallel (a quick [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) demo, etc.).
-   Possibly, [Makefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile).

## Core discussion {#core-discussion}

1.  ðŸ“° **Working with the literature:** tools and approaches. (2021-01-25)
       <a class="sticker" href="/tools/ts-literature/">&nbsp;Summary&nbsp;</a>
    -   Managing references (Zotero, JabRef, Mendeley and friends).
    -   Using the literature: latex/bibtex, editors, etc. (very brief)
    -   Discovering the literature (feeds, mailing lists, etc.)
    -   A note on notes.
2.  **ðŸ”€ All things version-control:** a quick intro to Git. (2020-02-01; summary: coming soon!)
    -   Version control, backups, when to use (always!)
    -   Git, github, and the team.
    -   Repositories (remote, local). Create, fork, `clone`, and other spells.
    -   Keeping track of your code/text: `add`, `commit`, `push/pull`.
    -   Workflow / branches -- `checkout, merge`, rebasing, conflicts.
3.  ðŸŒ§ **(Cloud) The Command Line - 1:** Surviving on the cloud. _(Next seminar)_
4.  ðŸŒ© **(Cloud) The Command Line - 2:** making it work for you.


## Additional topics (work in progress) {#additional-topics--work-in-progress}

1.  ðŸ’» **Introductory materials on Python**:
    -   Syntax basics / learning resources.
    -   Versions, environments, managing packages (`conda`, `pip`)
    -   Jupyter notebooks (extracting code, presenting, exporting, JupyterHub,
        etc. A word on alternatives)
    -   Optimization in Python (with [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) solver and `gurobipy`) -- a quick example.
    -   A word on scripting in Python (maybe a quick example).
    -   Further reading.
2.  ðŸ’» **Selected materials on Julia**. Note: we have a collection of materials on
    different topics related to [Julia](https://julialang.org/) from the previous year seminars by [Murwan
    Siddig](https://msiddig.people.clemson.edu/) -- see his  <a href="https://github.com/murwansiddig/Julia_tutorials">Julia tutorials</a> repo.
3.  ðŸ‘“ **Selected topics on programming.**
    -   Speeding up code in Python: special libraries, loops, vectorized computations, `map`,
        etc.
    -   "Profiling" python code ("what's so slow?")
    -   ... and in Julia: very brief notes on parallel computations and precompiling.
