Some materials that might be useful for teaching and/or self-study on matters
that have something to do with operations research, data science, and applied
math (and maybe even some tiny notes on bioinformatics – we’ll see).

**NOTE:** I am very interested in polishing these, so any thoughts and suggestions on the
content, form, or teaching process per se are highly appreciated. In particular,
should it happen you find a mistake / typo (which is very well possible) –
please, [let](/contact/) me know.
