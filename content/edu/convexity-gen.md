The textbook by [Bazaraa et
al](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Nonlinear+Programming%3A+Theory+and+Algorithms%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471486008)
provided a summary diagram describing connections between different classes of
functions (generalizing the concept convexity) in terms of "implications" (like
"strict convexity ‚ü∂ convexity") as well as detailed notes with examples.
However, I wanted to have a one-pager with the key information for quick
reference - definitions + short notes on intuition; preferably, with relations
being depicted as an [Euler
diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram). So, I tried to compile
everything together on one US Letter page.
