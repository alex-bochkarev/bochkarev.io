## Secure comm / Encryption
If you decide to use encryption, please consider:
- **Preferred:** GPG<sup>[what?](https://gnupg.org/)</sup> via email or
  Jabber/XMPP.<sup>[how?](#GPG)</sup>
- For a simpler (but potentially less secure) tool: contact me via
  [keybase](https://keybase.io/bochkarev) or just
  [encrypt](https://keybase.io/encrypt) your message for me (set `Recipient` to
  `bochkarev`) and then send the encrypted version in any convenient way.

## Notes on software
<a name="xmpp"><b>XMPP:</b></a> Highly likely that you are not aware of it: that's pretty old and unpopular technology these days. You'll need a client, such as [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) for Linux/Windows, or [Adium](https://adium.im/) for Mac (more [details](https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html)). But hey, your WhatsApp doesn't support inline LaTeX and end-to-end encryption with _my_ key, does it? Also, you can make this link clickable in Firefox, see [this](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/XMPP_URIs).

<a name="GPG"><b>GPG (ðŸ”‘):</b></a> the thing is not exactly user friendly. See, e.g., [this](https://futureboy.us/pgp.html) blogpost for more details on "how and why to use **G**NU **P**rivacy **G**uard". Also, there is a hardcore technical [manual](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html).

[^sym]: of course, you'd need to replace `\at/` and `[dot)` with the corresponding symbols.
