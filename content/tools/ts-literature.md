## Introduction {#introduction}

I would like to discuss the _problem_, i.e. requirements to an IT system
supporting my basic workflow, and then the _solution_ that worked for me. It
may or may not work for _you_ of course, but hopefully will provide some
inputs to design your own IT "ecosystem". Here is a very general (and
therefore, useless by itself) description of the relevant workflow:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/literature.png" >}}

This is a large topic, but roughly speaking the system[^fn:1] has two
key components that manage:

-   references (like, bibliography data, such as `.bib` entries, plain text
    authors-titles-year-etc, perhaps, along with PDF files);
-   notes (that reflect your thinking process related to this paper/piece of information).

It can be organized in **many** ways (including some good old paper-based versions
that were [reported](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2942475/2942530/jschmidt%5F2016%5Fniklas%20luhmanns%20card%20index.pdf) to be... very productive, to say the least[^fn:2]; a little
more on this below). I had the following specific **requirements** in mind:

-   The system must be **future-proof**. Research is (hopefully) a long-term
    endeavor, so lock-in with proprietary technologies is not acceptable. I must
    be able to move to an alternative solution, if I'd like to. Key data must be
    stored in some formats that allow for recovery with very basic tools (at least
    in theory): plain text is best, open standards and free software are my
    friends. Oh yes, and I don't want to store my data in cloud all the time, I
    love tools that work offline.
-   It must let me to do the following things:
    -   **capture** a paper from a browser easily (or any other _source_ -- maybe a
        web page, a book, etc.), retrieving bibliographical info automatically when
        possible (including metadata extraction from PDFs).
    -   **manage** references efficiently (edit fields, etc.), categorize things, etc.
    -   play well with **LaTeX** (mostly, looking for and inserting citations).
-   (something that I hope you will ignore:) a large benefit for me had anything
    that worked well within [Emacs](https://xkcd.com/378/).

The core component of such system is, of course, a _bibliography-_,
_citation-_, or _reference-manager_.


## On references and bibliography {#on-references-and-bibliography}

A [reference-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference%5Fmanagement%5Fsoftware) software is a tool that lets you to (surprise!) manage
references, i.e., bibliographical data: author, title, publisher data, etc.
That is, it captures and stores the bibliographical _data_ in some internal
format (e.g., a `.bib` file, an [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) database, etc.), and then can format it
as you'd like: using the chosen [citation style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation#Styles) and producing outputs in plain
text, word processor document, etc. It also usually helps to generate
bibliographies automatically, so that it updates when you update the text.

There are several key programs/services out there, and an infinite variety of
their comparative analyses:

-   Wikipedia has pretty large [comparison summary tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5Freference%5Fmanagement%5Fsoftware). It might be a good
    place to start, but the number of options is overwhelming.
-   Another detailed comparison was made in [Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1320978/1320978.pdf).
-   University libraries usually have brief overviews of the software they
    recommend: e.g., a nice one from [UCSD](https://ucsd.libguides.com/howtocite/compare), [U. of Pennsylvania](https://guides.library.upenn.edu/citationmgmt). Also:
    [MiT](https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write) (specifically on [citation management](https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write/citetools)), [Harvard](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/cite), [Stanford](https://library.stanford.edu/research/bibliography-management), [U. of
    Washington](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/citations/citation-tools),
-   There are numerous Reddit discussions (such as: [JabRef vs Zotero vs org-ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/iouswl/jabref%5Fvs%5Fzotero%5Fvs%5Forgref%5Fwhich%5Fone%5Fdo%5Fyou/))
-   Of course, there is a paper[^fn:3] on that: <sup id="75f526c79b18bb5e78cde1133fd1c1f6"><a href="#ivey2018" title="Ivey \&amp; Crum, Choosing the {{Right Citation Management Tool}}: {{Endnote}}, {{Mendeley}}, {{Refworks}}, or {{Zotero}}, {Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA}, v(3), 399--403 (2018).">ivey2018</a></sup>.

My personal short list would overlap with the Clemson Library's [one](https://libraries.clemson.edu/research/citation-management/)
(at the time of writing this): [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/); plus [Mendeley](https://mendeley.com/), [Refworks](https://refworks.proquest.com/researcher/)
(Clemson [guide](https://clemson.libguides.com/newrefworks)), [EndNote](https://endnote.com/) if I allow for commercial products (I have also read
some good things about [Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/) for Mac -- but never had a chance to look
myself). This list is not exhaustive (by far), so please refer to more
complete resources (including the ones mentioned above) if you'd need. Despite
the problem seems somewhat standard from the first sight, it seems that
different people demand different things, so there is no "universal" solution.
Instead of trying to discuss pros and cons, let me just try to sketch what
works for me.


## My Zotero-based system. {#my-zotero-based-system-dot}

Here is my system in a nutshell, from a technology perspective:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/system.svg" >}}

So, basically, I use the following tools:

-   Zotero desktop app
-   Firefox plugin (["Connector"](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors)) to fetch info from the web
-   Zotero addons (there is a larger [list](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins) of these):
    -   BetterBibTex to make the `.bib` related magic happen;
    -   LibreOffice integration (think MS Word);
    -   ZotFile to be able to manipulate PDFs easily, including sending them to the tablet.

Now, the "manuscript" part can be implemented, again in several ways, and the
purpose here is to supercharge your editor to get info from the `.bib` file. My
[Emacs (Spacemacs)](https://www.spacemacs.org/) handles this for me:[^fn:4]

I have a convenient (fuzzy) search / auto-completion when I insert the keys:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/org_insert_citation.gif" >}}

And also I can easily pull out a PDF or my notes when I need to:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/org_open_pdf_notes.gif" >}}

For these rare cases when I use MS Word-like environments, there are
LibreOffice and Google Docs integration:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/gdoc_insert_citation.gif" >}}

(It is also worth noting that you can just find a paper in Zotero and copy a
citation in the necessary citation style, e.g., as a plain text -- to insert it
anywhere.)

If you find it interesting -- there are many demos and tutorials on Zotero on
YouTube and other places (most probably, including a dedicated training in your
university library).

## A note on notes. {#a-note-on-notes-dot}

This is, actually, a separate topic. But if you feel the necessity to take
notes on your research in general (like an extended lab journal), there are
many options.

Basically, we are talking about a collection of interlinked notes. There are
several relevant "keywords" out there that I would like to mention.

-   First, one might take a technological perspective and look for software that
    allows to manage notes. This is, of course, good old Evernote[^fn:5],
    a newer and open source[^fn:6] [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).
-   There is and a vast variety of [wiki software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5Fwiki%5Fsoftware) (such as [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) or [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki),
    just to name a couple. But the list is huge.) Some of them are specifically
    positioned as a [Personal Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal%5Fwiki) (e.g., such as [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) -- see a nice 2.5
    minutes [intro video](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Introduction%20Video)).
-   There are specific solutions for working with an interconnected grid of
    "evergreen" notes (i.e., the ones you might edit every time when you visit
    them.) I would like to mention:
    -   [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). It looks totally exciting, but web-based (which
        is a big no-go for me);
    -   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Comparable thing, uses local storage, as far as I can tell.
        Ironically, I am not sure how good is it with citations/references ðŸ˜€.
        Never used it at all, but to me, it looks **very** promising (especially if
        it indeed keeps your information in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is essentially plain
        text, so you can open it in future no matter what).
    -   [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/). This is a part of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) ecosystem over the all-mighty[^fn:7]
        [orgmode](https://orgmode.org/). Free and open source, local solution. This is what I use
        currently.
-   Then, there is a story about Zettelkasten.


## Discovering the literature {#discovering-the-literature}

-   Feeds: RSS, atom
-   Mailing lists
-   Journal/reading club


## Concluding remarks and further reading {#concluding-remarks-and-further-reading}

-   We have Clemson Libraries [trainings/events](https://clemson.libcal.com/calendar/training?cid=3593&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=3593&inc=0), including ["Zotero for Citation Management"](https://clemson.libcal.com/event/7336551).
-   Now as I think about it: JabRef-based system might be better as it would
    have fewer moving parts, but as of now it seems not worth the hassle of
    setting everything up again...

[^fn:1]: Which is by the way a part of something that is usually called Personal Information Management ([PIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal%5Finformation%5Fmanagement)) or Personal Knowledge Management ([PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal%5Fknowledge%5Fmanagement)) systems. These two do not seem well-defined concepts, in my opinion, but do have something to do with very important topics, especially for a researcher.
[^fn:2]: This is in Sociology -- but I believe the benefits should translate well to STEM, at least to some extent.
[^fn:3]: Needless to say, this citation was inserted here using Zotero in under 1 minute (and I have a downloaded PDF as a by-product).
[^fn:4]: I use layers: `bibtex, pdf`, and `org-roam` + `org-roam-bibtex` along with `helm` and such (a mandatory link to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/my-spacemacs-dotfiles)). If you are into Emacs world, you might find it useful to watch this EmacsConf2020 [talk](https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/17/) by [Noorah Alhasan](https://noorahalhasan.com/), which discusses a very similar approach.
[^fn:5]: which I do not like as it is too much cloud-based and not, um... hacker friendly, to my feelings. For example, I do not quite understand how to export my stuff quickly and without losses, should I happen to need this...
[^fn:6]: From what I understand, it is actually free -- MIT-licensed.
[^fn:7]: Speaking about orgmode: you can check out this great Bernt Hansen's page to see what's possible. But despite I like this technology **a lot**, I must admit it is still a DIY type of thing, to my taste
