title: Privacy Policy

This is a private site hosting mostly my notes on various topics (which are
mostly of interest to myself, perhaps), so I do not inherently need any users'
data. Therefore, while I am definitely not an expert on how the underlying
technologies work, I do take deliberate efforts to maximize the *privacy* of
this website. To the best of my knowledge, it "interacts" with your data
in a *very* minimalist fashion (if at all), as described below.

If you spot any potential issue, or have a suggestion in this regard, please
let me know in an [email](mailto:privacy@bochkarev.io).

## Data collection
I have an intent to collect no information at all, besides maybe very technical
data that are strictly required to run the website. Nothing here asks you to
identify yourself. Some information might be collected by
[GitHub](https://github.com/about) (and the services they use), since the site
is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (please, see their
[Privacy
Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages)
for details). Note that, as such, I do not have access to these data (when, or
if collected).

The website is designed with an intent to make it self-contained, avoiding
requests to any external resources whenever possible. It does
*not* use, to the best of my knowledge, any of:
- Cookies (which may or may not help to identify users).
- Content-delivery networks, externally-hosted fonts, or icons.
- JavaScript --- with an exception for code docs generated by
  [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), which at least load MathJax
  from `cdnjs.cloudfare.com`. (But you will notice these pages are even visually
  distinct from the rest of the website.)
- Any sort of analytics[^fn:access]

I also tried my best to highlight external links (with special symbols near the
link, such as these ones: [external](https://www.example.com),
[wiki](https://wikipedia.org), [GitHub](https://github.com)).

## Use and sharing of your personal information
Since I have no access to your data, there is nothing I could share.

## Making choices about data collection
Note, however, that while I do not have an ultimate, fine-grained control over
the website due to the chosen hosting method, you still might be able to
configure your local software (web browser) to disable cookies and other means
of data collection. Please, refer to your browser's documentation. I believe,
related information is also available on the Internet.[^fn:privacytools]



[^fn:privacytools]: Some good starting points for your research on this might be
[privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/), [r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/) wiki and discussions on Reddit, and other sources.
[^fn:access]: ... at least that I would have access to and control over. In particular, I do not use Google Analytics, yes.
