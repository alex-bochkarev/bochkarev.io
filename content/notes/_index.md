Here is a complete list of my public notes that are not directly related to research or teaching, mostly covering tools and software I use. These are in no particular order: I tend to link them from elsewhere (private conversations, [twitter](https://twitter.com/a_bochka) posts, etc.)

Please [let](/contact/) me know if you'll spot a mistake or have a suggestion for these materials.
